# Cult of QoL - A Collection

* Removes intros.
* Cheese the fishing mini-game. (No need to press anything apart from the initial cast).
* Remove extra buttons from menus (Discord, bug report, Twitch etc.)
* Collect tithes/inspire all at once. Inspire has some quirks I'm working on (the main one being when a follower levels up(?), it comes from the follower you initiated the conversation with, not the follower that's levelling up.)
* Reverse the 200% golden fleece cap introduced in patch 1.0.12
* Double the rate the damage increases with the golden fleece.
* Halves (where possible) the cost of refining goods. Gets rounded up. i.e. something that costs 3 originally ends up being 2. Something that costs 10, becomes 5.
* Cure illness/exhaustion when a follower gains loyalty (the floaty white eyes thing).
* If you have multiple outhouses, followers should now go to the "less full" one more often than not.
* Unlock pre-order DLC and Twitch items (Plushie building, drops)
* You can now collect tithe from the oldies again. Brutal.

Each mod can be enabled/disabled individually from within the config.
