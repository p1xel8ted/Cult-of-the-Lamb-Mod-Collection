# Rebirth

* Followers can be reborn, allowing you to change their names, looks etc.
* First one is free; subsequent ones on the same follower require 25 Rebirth Tokens obtained from crusading. 
* * Source of the tokens is from killing enemies, destroying old bone piles (not the ones from enemies), dungeon chests and offering shrines and more.
* * The drop chance starts at 15% and scales with your dungeon luck modifier. 
* The followers' XP carries over, but there is a 10% chance they lose half of their XP and 1 level when reborn. There is a notification when this happens.
* Their old body stays; compost it, eat it. Up to you.
* Refine the tokens at your refineries for 15 bones!
* Send your followers on a mission to get tokens!
* Go on a quest yourself to get tokens!
