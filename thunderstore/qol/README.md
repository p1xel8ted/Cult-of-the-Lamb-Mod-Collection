# Cult of QoL - A Collection

* Removes intros.
* Cheese the fishing mini-game. (No need to press anything apart from the initial cast). The reeling UI is also hidden. Compatible with Auto-Fish accessability settings.
* Remove extra buttons from main menu and pause menus. (Discord, bug report, Twitch etc.)
* Collect tithes/inspire all at once (unless they're in prison, sleeping, using the bathroom or dissenting.)
* Reverse the damage change to the golden fleece introduced in 1.0.13.
* Double the rate the damage increases with the golden fleece.
* Halves (where possible) the cost of refining goods. Gets rounded up. i.e. something that costs 3 originally ends up being 2. Something that costs 10, becomes 5.
* Cure illness/exhaustion when a follower gains loyalty (the floaty white eyes thing).
* Unlock pre-order DLC and Twitch drops 1 to 7.
* You can now collect tithe from the oldies.
* Increase silo/fertilizer capacity to 32.
* Increase collection speed from certain structures (shrines, beds, chest near main portal, windmill(?))
* Turn off propaganda speakers of a night.
* Make the days longer. The default is 2x, and that already feels long.
* Manipulate game speed, or halt it. Not to be confused with day length, this makes EVERYTHING faster.). Left/Right arrow keys to change, default speed is the up key.
* Disable game over mechanic.
* Multiple tarot rare draw chance multiplier by 3 (goes from around 20% to 60%).
* Lumber/stone mines life span can be increased by 50%, 100% or unlimited.
* Receive a notification when one of the scarecrows catches a bird.
* "Heal" exhausted followers in the healing bays.
* Make lumber/mine/farm/refinery chests auto loot when nearby (like the chest near the main portal).
* Swap out follower necklaces.
* Receive notification when structures that use fuel run out.
* Modify run, dodge, and lunge speed.
* Modify base damage dealt.
* Receive notification when a bed has collapsed.
* Skip receive crown video.
* Mass collect resources from select structures. WIP*
* Remove New Game button when you have at least one save game.
* Enable Save on exit when quitting. UI is modified to reflect this.
* Quick save keybind to save whenever you want.
* Reworked weather mod to work with the new weather system in game.
* Few developer orientated changes to reduce junk log spam from the game.
* Disable the new ads and developer/publisher logos on the main menu.
* Customizable UI scale.
* Adjustments to the mass-bless/bribe etc. Still a little wonky, but better than before.
* Support for modifying settings in game via the mod menu if have the API installed.
* Load straight into a specified save game after menu splash.

Each mod can be enabled/disabled individually from within the config. There might be stuff I've missed.
