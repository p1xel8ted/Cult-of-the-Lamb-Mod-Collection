* Gets a random list of 2000 names from the randommer.io API for use when naming followers.
* The initial list is saved to a file where your save games are located to prevent having to make a request every time you start the game.
* Names are removed from the list as they are used to prevent duplicates.
* The provided API key is limited to 1000 requests per day. If you want to use your own API key, you can get one from [randommer.io](https://randommer.io/).
